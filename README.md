# <FFXI-Mob-Search-Database>
> A program that searches mobs in FFXI based on their item drops.

## Usage

```environment.rb``` should be updated to match your database connection settings. Running each of the schema files will create the tables, which can then be populated with the seed files. Once the database is set up, running ```main.rb``` will allow you to search by entering an item. The program will display all matching mobs that drop the item, along with the drop rate and zone they spawn in.
